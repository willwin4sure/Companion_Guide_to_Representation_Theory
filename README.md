# Companion Guide to Representation Theory

Welcome to our companion guide! This text should serve as a complementary resource for anyone reading Pavel Etingof's classical textbook *Introduction to representation theory*. Throughout this document, you can find solutions to selected problems from the book, as well as some further exposition, explanation, and intuition behind many of the theorems and proofs presented.

Unlike a typical set of "notes," we try to avoid simply "copying from the textbook." Instead, we seek to fill particular holes in the textbook's explanations and proofs to help readers fully understand the material presented.
